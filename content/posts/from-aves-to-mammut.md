I'm moving from Twitter over to Mastodon! If you want to stay connected, you can find me at [@tarper24@pawsitiv.space](https://social.pawsitiv.space/@tarper24).

What the heck does Aves or Mammut have to do with anything?
Well, I'm moving from Twitter, aka blue bird site, to Mastodon.
Aves is the class that birds belong to, and Mammut is the genus that a mastodon belongs to.

A lot has gone down with Twitter over the past few years, and I decided I wanted out.
I heard about Mastodon some time ago and kept it on my radar, and with the recent events, I decided to make the move.

I set up a Mastodon instance called [Pawsitiv Space](https://pawsitiv.space), and plan to use it as my main social media platform.
If you'd like to join me there, you can sign up at [social.pawsitiv.space](https://social.pawsitiv.space).
I think it'll likely become my main social media platform, but I'll still be on Discord and Telegram, of course.

I also plan to start using this blog, which is why I made it in the first place.
So, expect longer form content here, and shorter form posts on Pawsitiv Space.
I'll likely link to my posts here from Pawsitiv Space.

I haven't been on Twitter for a few weeks now, and I miss seeing the updates from my friends.
I'll probably start keeping tabs on Twitter again, but I'll be using it as a read-only platform.
I am expecting to continue seeing people moving to the Fediverse.

I hope you'll join me in the Fediverse!
Whether on Pawsitiv Space or elsewhere, follow me with my username above.
