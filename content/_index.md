## About Me

Heya! I'm tarper24, welcome to my personal website and blog.

I love making and tinkering with stuff (especially technology related), playing games (tabletop, board, or video), and watching anime and movies.
I'm also a furry and enjoy all things cute, cuddle, fluffy, etc.

For now, I'm mostly using this site as a blog.
Content will likely be sporadic, but I'll try to remember it exists!
You can find me on [Pawsitiv Space](https://pawsitiv.space) and elsewhere through my [Lynx](https://t24.co).
